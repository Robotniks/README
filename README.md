                Hello anthropoid-like figure,I'm Robotnik.<br>
                I usually don't release stuff though I'm trying to get into the habbit of doing so.<br>
                All the projects I release to the public are for educational purposes <br>
                At the moment I'll be releasing a variety of discord API projects though I'll spread it out<br>

<h1 align='center'>Summary</h1>

I code C++,C#,Python,GoLang and Java.I'm currently studying JavaScript and SQL.The supercomputers I am showing here are powerful almost beyond human understanding. They can map every molecule of the billions on a human DNA string, scrutinize at the atomic level the collision between two pieces of plutonium in an exploding bomb; or sketch the gravitational pull of every star in the galaxy. There are not questions that humans could grapple with given plenty of time, a notebook and a sharp pencil. These computers are not amiable assistants they are distant and sinister; cold and inscrutable. They are omniscient and omnipresent and these are not qualities in which we find a simulacrum of ourselves â€“ these are qualities that describe the Divine. The problem is not that these computers might one day resemble humans. It is that they already resemble gods.
